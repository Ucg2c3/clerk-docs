> [!WARNING]
> By default, the [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} (FAPI) accepts cross-origin requests from **any** subdomain of your configured root domain, which increases your application's attack surface. For security purposes, it is strongly recommended to restrict which subdomains are allowed to make these requests by configuring a [subdomain allowlist](/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/subdomain-allowlist).
