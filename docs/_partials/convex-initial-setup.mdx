## Set up Clerk as a Convex auth provider

For your Clerk session token to work with Convex, you need to set up the Convex integration in Clerk.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [Convex integration setup](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).
1. Choose your configuration options, and then select **Activate Convex integration**. This will reveal the [Frontend API URL](!frontend-api-url) for your Clerk instance.
1. Save the URL. In development, its format is `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format is `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

## Map additional claims (optional)

If you need to map additional claims, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/sessions) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.
