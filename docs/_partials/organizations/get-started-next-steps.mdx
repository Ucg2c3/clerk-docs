You've added Clerk Organizations to your app 🎉.

Here are some next steps you can take to scale your app:

- **Control access** with [Custom Roles and Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions): define granular Permissions for different user types within Organizations.

- **Onboard entire companies** with [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains): automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g. `@company.com`) to join Organizations without manual invitations.

- **Enable Enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso): let customers authenticate through their identity provider (e.g. Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
